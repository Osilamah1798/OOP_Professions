Algorithm: Managing Professions

1. Define the Professions class:

   a. Implement the constructor method '__init__':
      - Initialize an empty list called 'professions' to store details of professionals.

   b. Implement a method 'add_profession' within the class:
      - Takes parameters for name, profession type, and experience.
      - Appends a dictionary containing these details to the 'professions' list.

   c. Implement a method 'log_professions' within the class:
      - Prints a header indicating that the following output will display professions.
      - Iterates through each profession in the 'professions' list.
      - Prints the name, type, and experience of each profession.

2. Create an instance of the Professions class named 'professions'.

3. Start adding professions interactively:
   a. Begin an indefinite loop.
   b. Prompt the user to enter the name of a professional or 'done' to finish.
   c. If the user enters 'done', exit the loop.
   d. Otherwise, ask for the profession type and experience of the professional.
   e. Call the 'add_profession' method of the 'professions' instance to add the entered details to the list.

4. After exiting the loop, call the 'log_professions' method to display the details of all added professions.
